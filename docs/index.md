# BUA Vivo Ontology extensions

The [VIVO](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO) software is an open source software and an ontology for representing scholarship. In the context of information technologies, Ontologies are formal representation of entities within a specific domain, their attributes, and relations between the entitites in the domain. In the case of the VIVO software,ontologies represent the American academic domain, semantically and structurally relating research entities

As the German Berlin University Alliance (BUA) VIVO project had as a goal to represent and interconnect researchers and research artefacts between the members using VIVO, we needed to extend and redefine concepts in order to semantically represent the German academic domain.

The alliance comprises 4 knowledge domains from 3 universities and one University Hospital, and as the institutional structures are termed differently inbetween them, and sometimes also internally within domains and institutions, it is important that each member could model their own idiosyncrasies according to their own culture, while still being thematically closely related, as they inherit concepts from a [common upper ontology](https://bua-vivo.github.io/bua-upper-ontology/) securing a certain degree of computability between the institutions.

This process was informed largely through the production of “Organigrams”, or  ontologies mapping their institutional organisation. The mapping helps in understanding the idiosyncrasies of each domain as well as the common entities across domains, thus informing the extensions of the ontologies.
