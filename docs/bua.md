# BUA-wide Ontology extensions

Since the base underlying VIVO ontologies represent and express the semantics of entities within the American academic domain, one need to redefine and extend the ontologies to mirror the local domains, in our case, the German academic domain.

Our work is an extensin of earlier work done by the [vivo-DE](https://github.com/VIVO-DE/vivo-de-ontology-extension), which added some entities native to Germany, as well as addressing entities with semantic ambiguity such as the "Faculty"

The BUA-wide Ontology, defines 35 entities, some part of organizational and subject sprecific structural elements, as well as some resource output type definitions, giving a basis to represent some new reseource types not already present in the base vivo ontology

The ontology makes a basis for the development of the [BUA upper ontology](https://bua-vivo.github.io/bua-upper-ontology/) which serves as an upepr abstraction level to bind the alliance member vivo ontology extensions
